This is my solution to Exercise 3

This can be found at https://github.com/BenjaminLiuPenrose/PyAssignmentSolution

First, go to 3_Solution, run 3.1_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at the latter part of the code line

Second, go to 3_Solution, run 3.2_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at the latter part of the code line
implementation code for this part can be found at 3_Solution\Implementations\Loans\LoanPool.py

Third, go to 3_Solution, run 3.3_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at the latter part of the code line
implementation code for this part can be found at 3_Solution\Implementations\Loans\Loan.py

Fourth, go to 3_Solution, run 3.4_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at the latter part of the code line
implementation code for this part can be found at 3_Solution\Implementations\Timer.py
