Exercise 2.2.2
# Create a MortgageMixin class which will contain mortgage-specific methods. In particular, weâ€™d like
# to implement the concept of Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). For those unaware, PMI is an extra 
# monthly payment that one must make to compensate for the added risk of having a Loan-to-Value (LTV) 
# ratio of less than 80% (in other words, the loan covers >= 80% of the value of the asset).
# To this end, implement a function called PMI that returns 0.0075% of the loan face value, but only 
# if the LTV is < 80%. For now, assume that the initial loan amount is for 100% of the asset value
# Additionally, override the base class monthlyPayment and principalDue functions to account for PMI 
# (Hint: use super to avoid duplicating the formulas, and note that the other methods (interestDue, 
# balance, etc.) should not require any changes)

Exercise 2.2.3
# Create a VariableMortgage and FixedMortgage class. These should each derive-from the appropriate 
# base class(es) (TBD by student)
