Main program:
# Exercise 6.1.1
# Write code that generates a list of 200,000 uniform random numbers, ranging from 1 to 20. Additionally, 
# generate 200,000 normally distributed random numbers (mu=10, sigma=7) and 200,000 lognormally distributed 
# random numbers (mu=1, sigma=0.5). Export these lists of numbers to a single CSV file (should have 200,000 
# rows and three columns):
# a. Open this CSV file in Excel.
# b. Create three additional Excel Worksheets (named ‘Uniform’, ‘Normal’, and ‘Lognormal’). Name the original 
# Worksheet ‘Input’.
# c. In each Worksheet, create a Histogram corresponding to its input data column (Insert->Histogram).
# d. Notice how the Uniform graph appears almost flat, the normal graph appears to be a bell curve, and the 
# lognormal graph appears to be a bell curve with a large tail.
# This is an example of convergence due to the Law of Large Numbers: If you generate enough random numbers 
# using a certain distribution, it will always start to converge to the distribution.
# Note that you will need to save the result as an Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) instead of .csv for submission

# Exercise 6.1.2
# Do the same thing as Exercise 1, but this time we are going to print the distribution in the Python 
# shell output. You can do this using horizontal dashes (-). The naïve approach would be to print one dash 
# for each time a certain number appears (each number getting its own row of dashes). However, the frequencies 
# will be in the thousands, so using one dash per frequency will overflow the screen. Therefore, to do this 
# properly, you need to scale all the frequencies down (this is called normalizing the curve). We wish to 
# scale each frequency in the histogram to have a min of 1 dash and a max of 100 dashes. We can do so using 
# the following formula:
# Also, note that you will need to round each decimal value to the nearest integer (we don’t wish to have a 
# separate frequency entry for every decimal). Example output:
# 1: ---
# 2: --------
# 4: -----------
# 7: -------
# 8: --
# 11: -

# Exercise 6.1.3
# The following is a famous problem in probability based on a game show. It has generated much controversy 
# due to the non-intuitive nature of the solution. The objective of this exercise is to write a simulation 
# of the game that empirically demonstrates the accepted solution is indeed the correct solution. 
# The game/problem is as follows:
# You are presented with three doors. Behind one of the doors is a brand-new Lamborghini. Behind the other 
# two doors are goats. You do not know which door contains the Lamborghini.
# The game show host asks you to choose one door; you choose a door. The host then opens one of the two doors 
# that you did not choose and behind that door is a goat. The host then gives you the following options: Either 
# stay with your originally chosen door or switch doors to the remaining, closed door.
# Should you stay, switch, or it makes no difference?
# To solve this problem, do the following:
# a) Note down your hypothesis (you may have heard the solution to this famous problem already – no problem!)
# b) Model the game/player using Python OOP. The player should be a class that defines the switch strategy and 
# has functions to choose a door and whether or not to switch. The game class should consist of a player object 
# and the game logic.
# c) The game class should have a playGame function which does the following:
# a. Randomly places the prize behind one of three doors.
# b. Asks its player object to choose a door.
# c. Figure out which door to ‘open’ (it should be one of the two non-selected doors, but it must not have the 
# prize behind it). Query the player object whether or not to switch to the remaining door (the player object 
# should either always switch or always not switch).
# d. Check if the final chosen door is a winner or loser and return the Boolean result.
# d) Play the game one time from main to verify that it works.
# e) Play the game in a loop of 10,000,000 times from main and store the results of each play in a list. The 
# average of this list should be the approximate probability of winning with your chosen strategy (hold or 
# switch). Time this function (it may take some time).
# f) Was your hypothesis correct?
# Congrats on your first Monte Carlo simulation in Python! The subsequent exercises will look to speed thus 
# up by using multi-processing in Python
