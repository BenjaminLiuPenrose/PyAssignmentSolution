Main program:
# Exercise 2.1.2
# Create a basic Loan class exactly as demonstrated in the lecture (including the setter/getter property methods). 
# Then, extend it with methods that return the following (refer to the slides for any necessary formulas):
# a. The monthly payment amount of the Loan (monthlyPayment). Even though monthlyPayment is likely to be equal for 
# all months, you should still define this with a dummy ‘period’ parameter, since it’s possible some loan types will 
# have a monthly payment dependent on the period.
# b. The total payments of the Loan (totalPayments). This is principal plus interest.
# c. The total interest of the Loan (totalInterest).

# Exercise 2.1.3
# Interest due at time T on a loan depends on the outstanding balance. Principal due is the monthly payment 
# less the interest due. Conceptually, these are recursive calculations as one can determine the interest/principal 
# due at time T if one knows the balance at time T-1 (which, in turn, can be determined if one knows the balance 
# at time T-2).
# For each of the below functions, implement two versions: A recursive version (per the above statement) and a 
# version that uses the formulas provided in the slides:
# a. The interest amount due at a given period (interestDue).
# b. The principal amount due at a given period (principalDue).
# c. The balance of the loan at a given period (balance).
# Use your Timer class to time each version of each function; what do you observe? What happens as the time period increases?

# Exercise 2.1.4
# To demonstrate understanding of class-level methods, do the following:
# a. Implement a class-level method called calcMonthlyPmt, in the Loan base class. This should calculate a monthly 
# payment based on three parameters: face, rate, and term.
# b. Create a class-level function, in the Loan base class, which calculates the balance (calcBalance). Input 
# parameters should be face, rate, term, period.
# c. Test the class-level methods in main.
# d. Modify the object-level methods for monthlyPayment and balance to delegate to the class-level methods.
# e. Test the object-level methods to ensure they still work correctly.
# f. What are the benefits of class-level methods? When are they useful?

# Exercise 2.1.5
# To demonstrate understanding of static-level methods, do the following:
# a. Create a static-level method in Loan called monthlyRate. This should return the monthly interest 
# rate for a passed-in annual rate
# b. Create another static-level method that does the opposite (returns an annual rate for a passed-in monthly rate).
# c. Test the static-level method in main.
# d. Modify all the Loan methods that rely on the rate to utilize the static-level rate functions.
# e. What are the benefits of static-level methods? When are they useful?
