Main program:
Exercise 2.2.1
# As shown in the lecture, create derived classes as follows:
# a. A FixedRateLoan class which derives from Loan.
# b. A VariableRateLoan class which derives from Loan. This should have its own __init__ function that 
# sets a _rateDict attribute on the object and then invokes the super-classâ€™ __init__ function. Override 
# the base-class rate function as follows:
# Modify the Loan class functions to use the rate (or getRate) function to get the rate for the current 
# period. Note that the monthly payment and balance formulas are different in this Variable case

Implementations:
