for Exercise 6.1.1, data is in the Excel file
for Exercise 6.1.2 and 6.1.3, run 6.1_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at the latter part of the code line
implementation code for this part can be found at 6.1_Solution\Implementations\PlayerGame.py

Second, go to 6.2_Solution, 
for Exercise 6.2.1, run 1.2_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
