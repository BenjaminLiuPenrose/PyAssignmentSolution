Open CaseStudy.pdf in my folder (with my side notes), you will see the hightlighted area in pdf I will implement in this program and I will use Part1.1 etc to refer to them

Go to folder Solution
Firstly, for Part 1 
run Part1_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at Solution\Implementations\Tranches\*.py

Secondly, for Part 2 
run Part2_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at Solution\Implementations\Tranches\TrancheBase.py

Lastly, for Part 3
run Part3_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at Solution\Implementations\Loans\LoanBase.py, LoanPool.py
implementation code for this part can be found at Solution\Implementations\Tranches\StructuredSecurity.py
