This is my solution to Exercise 1

This can be found at https://github.com/BenjaminLiuPenrose/PyAssignmentSolution

First, go to 1.1_Solution, run 1.1_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at the latter part of the code line

Second, go to 1.2_Solution, run 1.2_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at 1.2_Solution\Implementations\Implementation.py

Third, go to 1.3_Solution, run 1.3_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at 1.2_Solution\Implementations\Implementation.py

Fourth, go to 1.4_Solution, run 1.4_Main.py in shell, follow the instrcutions in shell step by step
implementation code for this part can be found at 1.2_Solution\Implementations\Implementation.py
